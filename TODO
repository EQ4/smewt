* Faster algorithm for retrieving metadatas and medias.  (e.g. view all series for which we have medias) (Virtuoso should do the job)
* Make the dirselector show those folders that are checked but not in the current directory model (e.g. removable devices)
* Views should only input as argument the collection
* subtitle display / fetching should be up to par for movies as well, not only series


* blocker bug: control+c and exit from menu when importing gives the following exception. Collection is then corrupted and cannot be loaded:
