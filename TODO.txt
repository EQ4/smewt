FEATURES:
---------

- make Smewt use GuessIt
- generate the thumbnails for the speeddial from the actual views content (ie: not some pre-generated thumbnails)
- tasks should be interruptible (so that exit works instantly instead of waiting for current task to complete)
- clean collection (ie: remove files which don't exist anymore)
- player detection in windows/linux

- merge the taggers and guessers and solvers into GuessIt, along with periscope, to have a library that is
  able to retrieve any type of information from a file: web info, possible subtitles, etc... (renaming: MediaInfo?)


BUGFIXES:
---------

- collection folder is ugly slow on windows (some only?)
- taskbar icon doesn't appear in all windows (confirmed?)
- moviefilename and episodefilename should add some MD to media, not metadata (eg: guessit.video info)
- in Tagger.cleanup(), the check to matches should be unnecesary, we shouldn't use that anymore


MISCELLANEOUS:
--------------

- delete old stuff
- clean python imports (ie: no 'from PyQt4.QtCore import *')
- make smewt pylint and pychecker (http://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2011/01/26/pychecker-python-code-analysis/) compliant, as much as possible


- how can we enhance this? (should be the first one):
